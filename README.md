# AD2 CW Supermarket Microservice

Welcome to the **AD2 CW Supermarket Microservice** project! This project is designed to provide a scalable, modular architecture for managing a supermarket's core operations. It includes microservices for handling inventory, orders, employees, and product data. Each service is built as a separate microservice with its own API, following modern microservice architecture principles, and is integrated using Spring Boot.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a supermarket system by implementing the following microservices:

- **Inventory Service** ‚Äì Manages the inventory of products in the supermarket, including adding, removing, and updating product quantities.
- **Order Service** ‚Äì Handles the order creation, order status tracking, and order history.
- **Employee Service** ‚Äì Manages the employees working in the supermarket, including employee details, roles, and tasks.
- **Product API Service** ‚Äì Exposes the product details, such as name, price, and description, and allows the system to fetch product information.

The microservices are designed to be independent but communicate with each other via RESTful APIs.
